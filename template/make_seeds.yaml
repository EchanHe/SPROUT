# The relative path from the workspace of input image
# The actual path will be workspace + file_name

# num of threads, it would be best to match the length of target_thresholds
num_threads: 2

# A list of thresholds for seed generation
# Seeds will be generated based on each individual threshold
thresholds: [140,130,120]

# An int for the erosion iteration for seed generation
# The current version will save seeds every iteration until ero_iters

# Integer >=1, The algorithm keeps top <segments> largest disconnected components
segments: 30
# Output folder for the seeds

# The name of the output folder
# A folder of workspace + output_folder

#### Optional parameters ####
## Can be commented out if you want to use the default values


# The root folder for processing data
# Workspace can be set as ""
# Then the input_folder and output_folder need to be absolute paths
# workspace: ""


# The upper thresholds, should be bigger than threshold
# Can be one number or a list, should be same length as the thresholds
# If specified, if you want binary to be img>= threshold & img<=upper_threshold
# upper_thresholds: [50,60]

# Path to boundary image. Defaults is None.
# boundary_path: './data/boundary.tif'

# How to erode your images, current supports 
# Default is None, when set as None, it will use preset footprints, which can be found in the script
#'ball' and 'cube' :Erosion all directions. 
#'ball_XY', 'ball_XZ', 'ball_YZ': Erosion on the Plane. 
# 'X', 'Y', 'Z': Erosion on the axis.
# footprints: "ball" 


# Is saving meshes, default is False
# is_make_meshes: False

# Scale for downsampling the meshes, Default is 10
# downsample_scale: 10

# Step size in Marching Cubes alogrithms, Default is 1
# The higher number makes the mesh simpler
