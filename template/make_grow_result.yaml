# Default workspace value is ""

# A list of thresholds that the grow algorithm is growing on
# Order matters, normally from high to low (available space to grow: from less to more)
# If there is only one threshold, please also include the []
thresholds: [200, 190, 180, 170, 160, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100]


# A list of dilation steps to grow on each threshold
# Order matters, and should have the same length to thresholds
# one element example: dilate_iters: [30]
dilate_iters: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]
# dilate_iters: [30]

# Keep it "stop for now"
touch_rule: "stop"
# The name of the output folder
# A folder of workspace + output_folder
output_folder: "./result/demo_dog/grow"

# Save the grow result every n iters
save_interval: 5

# Number of threads
num_threads: 4


#### Optional parameters ####
## Can be commented out if you want to use the default values

# The root folder for processing data
# Workspace can be set as ""
# Then the input_folder and output_folder need to be absolute paths
# workspace: ""


# The upper thresholds, should be bigger than threshold
# Can be one number or a list, should be same length as the thresholds
# If specified, if you want binary to be img>= threshold & img<=upper_threshold
# upper_thresholds: [50,60]

# Path to boundary image. Defaults is None.
# boundary_path: './data/boundary.tif'

# Whether grow to the very end, override the dilate_iters.
# It will grow the result as close to the thresholded mask as possible
# Default is False
# grow_to_end: False

# The final_grow_output_folder for saving the final grow
# Default is None, and the final_grow_output_folder will be same as output_folder
# None is ~ in yaml
# final_grow_output_folder: ~


# The name prefix, default is "final_grow"
# name_prefix: "final_grow"
# Whether use simple naming, the original naming can be long
# simple_naming: True

# if you want to grow on all ids, put a ~
# Default is None/~
# Example for growing on classes 1,3,5:
# to_grow_ids: [1,3,5]
# to_grow_ids: ~

# If want to sort class id by comp size. Default is True
# is_sort: True

# Early stop checking: 
# Limit for consecutive no-growth iterations. Defaults is 3.
tolerate_iters: 3

# The minimum difference to consider there is a growth in a dilation iteration
# Default is 50
min_diff: 50

## Optional parameters: saving mesh ##
# Is saving meshes, default is False
is_make_meshes: False
# Scale for downsampling the meshes, Default is 10
downsample_scale: 10
# Step size in Marching Cubes alogrithms, Default is 1
# The higher number makes the mesh simpler
step_size: 1
