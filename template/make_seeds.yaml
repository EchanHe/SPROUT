#### Optional parameters ####
## Can be commented out if you want to use the default values


## An optional root folder for processing data
# Default it none
# If it's set The image path will be workspace + img_path 
# The output_folder will be workspace + output_folder 
# workspace: ""


# The upper thresholds, should be bigger than threshold
# Can be one number or a list, should be same length as the thresholds
# If specified, if you want binary to be img>= threshold & img<=upper_threshold

# Path to boundary image. Defaults is None.

# How to erode your images, 
# Default is None, when set as None, it will use preset footprints, which can be found in the script
# it can be either a string, 
# or a list of string that matches the number of erosions
# Current supports 
#'ball' and 'cube' :Erosion all directions. 
#'ball_XY', 'ball_XZ', 'ball_YZ': Erosion on the Plane. 
# 'X', 'Y', 'Z': Erosion on the axis.
# footprints: "ball" 


# The base name of output, default is None, will try to use the image name
# If img_path is None, it will be "seed"
