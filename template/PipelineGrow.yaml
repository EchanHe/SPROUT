### Must-have inputs

# The path to the CSV file
# Must have column: img_path, seg_path
# If boundary_path is included, seed generation will read in boundary as well
csv_path: "./data/test_batch_boundary/input.csv"

touch_rule: "stop"
num_threads: 10

### Flexible  Inputs: either in the csv or here (.yaml) ###
dilate_iters: 2
thresholds: [3400,2400]
output_folder: "./data/test_batch_boundary/seed_all"
save_interval: 1

#### Optional inputs ####
## Can be commented out if you want to use the default values

# Whether grow to the very end, override the dilate_iters.
# It will grow the result as close to the thresholded mask as possible
# Default is False
grow_to_end: False

# The name prefix, default is "final_grow"
name_prefix: "final_grow"
# Whether use simple naming, the original naming can be long
simple_naming: True

# if you want to grow on all ids, put a ~
# Default is None/~
# Example for growing on classes 1,3,5:
# to_grow_ids: [1,3,5]
to_grow_ids: ~

# If want to sort class id by comp size. Default is True
is_sort: True
# The minimum difference to consider there is a growth in a dilation iteration
# Default is 50
min_diff: 50

# Early stop checking: 
# Limit for consecutive no-growth iterations. Defaults is 3.
tolerate_iters: 3


## Optional parameters: saving mesh ##
# Is saving meshes, default is False
is_make_meshes: False
# Scale for downsampling the meshes, Default is 10
downsample_scale: 10
# Step size in Marching Cubes alogrithms, Default is 1
# The higher number makes the mesh simpler
step_size: 1
